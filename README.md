## 🚀 What I'm Doing Now

**Lead AI Engineer at Deutsche Telekom**
Building, scaling, and governing AI Agents using Google's **Agent Development Kit (ADK)**, Agent Builder, and Agent Engine.

### 🏆 Featured: OneBot (Multi-Agent Customer Support)
- **Live in Production**: Serving millions of customers at [telekom.de](https://www.telekom.de)
- Handling **7,500+ concurrent sessions** and **25,000+ questions daily**—reducing human agent escalations by **40%** while driving **20% year-over-year operational savings**
- Multi-agent architecture answering complex customer support queries across Telekom's European markets
- Built with enterprise-grade reliability and governance

## 🛠️ What I Build

I build end-to-end **AI agents and ship** production systems that can be used immediately—which solve real problems and add value to the org/customer.

- **AI Agents**: Single-agent → Multi-agent → MCP-based → Browser agents → Voice agents → Local agents
- **Agent Architectures**: Crews, swarms, hierarchical planning, tool orchestration, memory management, eval frameworks
- **RAG Systems**: Simple chains → Agentic RAG → Hybrid search (BM25 + Cross-encoders) → Local RAG with Gemma/Llama
- **Chat-With-Anything**: GitHub, Gmail, PDFs, videos, research papers (production-grade parsing + retrieval)
- **Fine-Tuning**: Gemma, Llama, and OSS models using PEFT/LoRA/QLoRA for instruction tuning
- **Production Systems**: Conversation AI platforms with human-in-the-loop, monitoring, and governance
